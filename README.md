My project is titled Final-Project-campus-life-super-app. It includes contacts, menu information, a calendar, a functioning gif, and drop down buttons. To utilize this website, click the navigation buttons at the top to go to different pages. On the third page, click on each upcoming event to learn more about RSVP info. Future improvements could be had in including more links to external school sources and ensuring that the Dining and Calendar and Events page can update automatically per each week.
